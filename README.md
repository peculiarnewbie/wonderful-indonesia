# Wonderful Indonesia

a project created for threlte warp 2023 hackaton event: [Threlte Hackathon](https://threlte.xyz/hackathon).

I've always loved geography, data visualizations and maps that people made have always been a big part of that. It helps show the uniqueness and complexities of a given region. Hopefully this project can help aid in that

### Credits

- built with Threlte, still kinda mind-blown of how easy it handles hundreds of thousands of 3d objects
- using the population data from European Union's Global Human Settlement Layer [Global Human Settlement - GHSL Homepage - European Commission (europa.eu)](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/)
- used geotiff.js library to manipulate the GHSL data [geotiff.js](https://github.com/geotiffjs/geotiff.js/)
- tailwindcss for easy styling
- and obviously svelte, which continues to be an amazingly easy frontend framework to work with
